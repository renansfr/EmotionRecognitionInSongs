NASA Lyrics	
[Intro: Shangela Laquifa Wadley]	
This is one small step for woman	negative
One giant leap for woman-kind	fear
[Verse 1]	
I'd rather be alone tonight	Fear
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight	joy
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight	sadness
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight	Fear
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight	Sad
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight	Sad
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight	anticipation
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight	negative
[Pre-Chorus]	
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby	joy
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you	Sad
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you	anticipation
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial	anticipation
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A	
[Chorus]	Surprise
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space	Fear
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need	
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space	anticipation
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)	
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space	Fear
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need	
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space	anticipation
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)	
[Verse 2]	
Bottom line	Fear
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night	joy
I just think I'm on another page tonight	Surprise
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time	anticipation
Usually, I would orbit around you	Fear
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me	Sad
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm	positive
[Pre-Chorus]	
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you	Sad
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you	anticipation
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial	anticipation
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A	
[Chorus]	Surprise
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space	Fear
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need	
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space	anticipation
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)	
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space	Fear
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need	
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space	anticipation
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)	
[Bridge]	Fear
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover	sadness
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under	
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover	sadness
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)	sadness
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under	
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)	
[Outro]	
I'd rather be alone tonight (Mmm)	Fear
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight	joy
Ah, hmm-mmm
