Me and all my friends	Happy
They say we stand for nothing and	Fear
There's no way we ever could	Surprise
Now we see everything that's going wrong	negative
With the world and those who lead it	positive
We just feel like we don't have the means	Sad
To rise above and beat it	Surprise
So we keep waiting (Waiting)	Surprise
Waiting on the world to change	fear
We keep on waiting (Waiting)	Surprise
It's hard to beat the system	trust
When we're standing at a distance	positive
Now if we had the power	Angry
To bring our neighbors home from war	negative
They would have never missed a Christmas	Fear
But when you trust your television	trust
Cause when they own the information, oh	positive
They can bend it all they want	Angry
That's why we're waiting (Waiting)	Surprise
Waiting on the world to change	fear
We keep on waiting (Waiting)	Surprise
It's not that we don't care	Angry
We just know that the fight ain't fair	negative
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)	Surprise
And we're still waiting (Waiting)	Surprise
One day our generation	Happy
Is gonna rule the population	positive
Now we keep on waiting (Waiting)	Surprise
Paper doll, come try it on	joy
Step out of that black chiffon	sadness
Here’s a dress of gold and blue	sadness
Sure was fun being good to you	anticipation
This one we made just for fall	sadness
And winter runs a bit too small	negative
This mint green is new for Spring	joy
My love didn't cost a thing	joy
You’re like twenty-two girls in one	Surprise
Was it just too far to fall	sadness
For a little paper doll	joy
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red	Fear
Tie your hair behind your head	Fear
Strap into some heels that hurt	sadness
Cut the cord and pull some strings	positive
Make yourself some angel wings	anticipation
And if those angel wings don’t fly	positive
Someone’s going to paint you another sky	positive
'Cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one	Surprise
Was it just too far to fall?	sadness
Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire	anticipation
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire	joy
So gorgeous, a man might cry	joy
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire	anticipation
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire	joy
Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal	disgust
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel	anticipation
You're gorgeous but you can't fly	joy
A hidden admirer sent me 	negative
roses white as fire	anticipation
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter	negative
