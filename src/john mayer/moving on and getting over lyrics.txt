Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me'Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the timeMoving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to beIt's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the timeTell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold ontoTell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light throughI'm one text away from being back againBut I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get overMoving on and getting overIt's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
And I sure would like to see you one more time[Outro]It's taken me so long just to say "so long"
And baby it's so wrong, but I'm moving onI'm gonna get a new girl
A something-I-can-do-girl'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Moving on, baby
Moving on
Moving on
