I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually changeAnd I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with meFathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters tooOh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing inSince the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he madeDaughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothersBoys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier onBut boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heartOn behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her worldSo fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters tooSo mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
