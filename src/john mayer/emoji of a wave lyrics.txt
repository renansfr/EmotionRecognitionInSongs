Emoji of a Wave Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Oh, honey
You don't have to try so hard
To hurt me
Don't worry
I been thinking bout you too
What do we do
[Pre-Chorus]
Your heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing me
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
[Chorus]
Oh, honey
Oh, honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on
[Verse 2]
Oh, honey
I been talking to myself
Just to hear you
And you're saying
Everything I wish you would
And it's so good
[Pre-Chorus]
It's raining on the mission bell
They're draining out the wishing well
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
[Chorus]
Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on
[Bridge]
I rose in you like morning light
And sheltered you asleep at night
It breaks my heart
It takes all the love I have to say
I know we're gonna be okay
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
[Chorus]
Oh, honey
Oh, honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
, 
and I know
That when it comes
I just hold on until it's gone
