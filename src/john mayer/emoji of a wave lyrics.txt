Oh, honeyYou don't have to try so hard
To hurt meDon't worry
I been thinking bout you too
What do we doYour heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing meIt's just a wave
It's just a waveAnd I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold onI been talking to myself
Just to hear you
And you're saying
Everything I wish you would
And it's so goodIt's raining on the mission bellThey're draining out the wishing wellIt's just a wave
It's just a waveAnd I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold onIt's just a wave
It's just a waveand I know
That when it comes
I just hold on until it's gone
