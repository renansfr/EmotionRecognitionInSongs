She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America tooShe's a good girl, crazy about ElvisIt's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yardAnd I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken heartsAnd I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'I want to glide down over MulhollandI want to write her, her name in the sky
