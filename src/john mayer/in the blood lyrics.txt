How much of my mother has my mother left in me?Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?How much of my father am I destined to become?Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I amHow much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?Does a broken home become another broken family?Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
