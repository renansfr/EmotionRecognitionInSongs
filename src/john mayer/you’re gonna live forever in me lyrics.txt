[Intro: Whistling]A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunatelyBut you're gonna live forever in meParts of me were made by youAnd planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the seaAnd you're gonna live forever in meI guarantee, it's your destinyLife is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the treeBut you're gonna live forever in meI guarantee, it's just meant to be[Interlude: Whistling]And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seatBut you're gonna live forever in me[Outro: Whistling]
