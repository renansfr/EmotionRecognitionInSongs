Youâ€™re Gonna Live Forever in Me Lyrics
[Intro: Whistling]
[Verse 1]
A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately
[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see
[Verse 2]
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea
[Chorus 2]
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny
[Verse 3]
Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree
[Chorus 3]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be
[Interlude: Whistling]
[Verse 4]
And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat
[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see
[Outro: Whistling]
