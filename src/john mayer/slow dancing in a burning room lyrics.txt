It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calmThis is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working onNobody's going to come and save you
We pulled too many false alarmsWe're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning roomYou were the one I tried to drawHow dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever sawI'll make the most of all the sadnessYou'll be a bitch, because you can
You try to hit me, just to hurt meSo you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understandWe're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning roomGo cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning roomDon't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
