Ooh, I've done it again
Dug a little deep and it's all caved in
Now, I free fall in a black hole
I know I'm getting warm 'cause I feel so coldBut I'm looking on the bright side now
Tryna figure out somehow
(None of this is real, no)
It's looking like a write off now
I think we need to talk like nowSo don't swear to God, He never asked you
It's not His heart you drove a knife through
It's not His world you turned inside out
Not His tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me

Deathblow, look at you goBrought a T-62 to a RodeoSo tall, it broke the fourth wallGuess my fairy tale has a few plot holesWell, I'm looking on the bright side now
Tryna figure out somehow
(None of this is real, no)
You can give the act up now
Yeah, go ahead and take a bowSo don't swear to God, He never asked you
It's not His heart you drove a knife through

Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me

Just a little faith in anyone or anything
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
