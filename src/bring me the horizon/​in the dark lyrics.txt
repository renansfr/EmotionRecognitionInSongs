â€‹in the dark Lyrics
In the dark, in the dark




Ooh, I've done it againDug a little deep and it's all caved inNow, I free fall in a black holeI know I'm getting warm 'cause I feel so cold




But I'm looking on the bright side nowTryna figure out somehow(None of this is real, no)It's looking like a write off nowI think we need to talk like now




So don't swear to God, He never asked youIt's not His heart you drove a knife throughIt's not His world you turned inside outNot His tears still rolling downJesus Christ, you're so damn coldDon't you know you've lost control?Forget about the things you think I knowNo secrets, you can't keep meIn the dark, in the dark




Deathblow, look at you go




Brought a T-62 to a Rodeo




So tall, it broke the fourth wall




Guess my fairy tale has a few plot holes




Well, I'm looking on the bright side nowTryna figure out somehow(None of this is real, no)You can give the act up nowYeah, go ahead and take a bow




So don't swear to God, He never asked youIt's not His heart you drove a knife throughIt's not His world you turned inside outNot His tears still rolling downJesus Christ, you're so damn coldDon't you know you've lost control?Forget about the things you think I knowNo secrets, you can't keep meIn the dark, in the darkNo secrets, you can't keep meIn the dark, in the dark




I'm not looking for salvationJust a little faith in anyone or anythingI'm not looking for salvationJust a little faith in anyone or anythingI'm not looking for salvation (Oh no, 'cause it's all come caving in)Just a little faith in anyone or anythingI'm not looking for salvationJust a little faith in anyone or anythingAnd it's time I knew you, so




Don't swear to God, He never asked you (Oh no)It's not His heart you drove a knife through (Oh no)It's not His world you turned inside out (So look me in the eye right now)Not His tears still rolling downJesus Christ, you're so damn coldDon't you know you've lost control?Forget about the things you think I knowNo secrets, you can't keep meIn the darkDon't swear to God, He never asked you (Oh no)It's not His heart you drove a knife through (Oh no)In the darkIt's not His world you turned inside out (So look me in the eye right now)Not His tears still rolling downJesus Christ, you're so damn coldDon't you know you've lost control?Forget about the things you think I knowNo secrets, you can't keep meIn the darkDon't swear to God, He never asked you (Oh no)It's not His heart you drove a knife through (Oh no)In the darkIt's not His world you turned inside out (Oh no)Not His tears still rolling down (You're so damn cold)Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold (You're so damn cold)Don't you know you've lost control? (Oh, oh)Forget about the things you think I knowNo secrets, you can't keep meIn the dark, in the darkNo secrets, you can't keep meIn the dark, in the dark
