I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the frontIt's funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony like a kick right to the teethIt fell apart right from the start
But I couldn't even see the forest for the treesI'm afraid you asked for thisYou got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spineYou made your bed when you worried about mineThis ends nowI wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the frontIt's kind of sad, 'cause what we had
Well, it coulda been something, I guess it wasn't meant to beSo how dare you try and steal my flame just 'cause yours faded?
Well, hate is gasoline, a fire fueling all my dreamsI'm afraid you asked for thisYou got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spineYou made your bed when you worried about mineThis ends nowI wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the frontYou can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadline
You can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadlineI wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the frontAnd now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
