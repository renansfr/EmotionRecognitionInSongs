True Friends Lyrics
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive youDon't you know, don't you know?True friends stab you in the front




It's funny how things work outSuch a bitter irony like a kick right to the teeth




It fell apart right from the startBut I couldn't even see the forest for the trees




I'm afraid you asked for this




You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine




You made your bed when you worried about mine




This ends now




I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive youDon't you know, don't you knowTrue friends stab you in the front?I wouldn't hold my breath if I was youYou broke my heart and there's nothing you can doAnd now you know, now you knowTrue friends stab you in the front




It's kind of sad, 'cause what we hadWell, it coulda been something, I guess it wasn't meant to be




So how dare you try and steal my flame just 'cause yours faded?Well, hate is gasoline, a fire fueling all my dreams




I'm afraid you asked for this




You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine




You made your bed when you worried about mine




This ends now




I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive youDon't you know, don't you knowTrue friends stab you in the front?I wouldn't hold my breath if I was youYou broke my heart and there's nothing you can doAnd now you know, now you knowTrue friends stab you in the front




You can run, but you can't hideTime won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadlineYou can run, but you can't hideTime won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadline




I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive youDon't you know, don't you knowTrue friends stab you in the front?I wouldn't hold my breath if I was youYou broke my heart and there's nothing you can doAnd now you know, now you knowTrue friends stab you in the front




And now you know, now you knowTrue friends stab you in the frontAnd now you know, now you knowTrue friends stab you in the front
