True Friends Lyrics
[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front
[Verse 1]
It's funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart right from the start
But I couldn't even see the forest for the trees
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm afraid you asked for this
You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now
[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
[Verse 2]
It's kind of sad, 'cause what we had
Well, it coulda been something, I guess it wasn't meant to be
So how dare you try and steal my flame just 'cause yours faded?
Well, hate is gasoline, a fire fueling all my dreams
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm afraid you asked for this
You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now
[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
[Bridge]
You can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadline
You can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadline
[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
[Outro]
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
