Cut me open and tell me what's inside
Diagnose me, 'cause I can't keep wondering why
And no, it's not a phase, 'cause it happens all the time
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin iceAm I broken? What's the chance I will survive?
Don't sugarcoat me, 'cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight, 'cause I'm running out of time
I need an antidote, now what can you prescribe?It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
And I'm going underI need a cure for me, 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy, 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me, 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy, 'cause my head wasn't wired for this worldI'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
