Avalanche Lyrics
Cut me open and tell me what's insideDiagnose me, 'cause I can't keep wondering whyAnd no, it's not a phase, 'cause it happens all the timeStart over, check again, now tell me what you find




'Cause I'm going out of frequencyCan anyone respond?




It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neckI never stood a chance, my heart has frozen overAnd I feel like I am treading on thin ice




Am I broken? What's the chance I will survive?Don't sugarcoat me, 'cause I feel like suicideJust give it to me straight, 'cause I'm running out of timeI need an antidote, now what can you prescribe?




It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neckI never stood a chance, my heart has frozen overAnd I feel like I am treading on thin iceAnd I'm going under




I need a cure for me, 'cause the square doesn't fit the circleGive me a remedy, 'cause my head wasn't wired for this worldI need a cure for me, 'cause the square doesn't fit the circleGive me a remedy, 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world




I'm going out of frequencyCan anyone respond?'Cause I'm going out of frequencyCan anyone respond?




It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neckI never stood a chance, my heart has frozen overAnd I feel like I am treading on thin iceAnd I'm going under




I need a cure for me, 'cause a square doesn't fit the circleGive me a remedy, 'cause my head wasn't wired for this worldI need a cure for me, 'cause a square doesn't fit the circleGive me a remedy, 'cause when it hits, well, it hits like an avalanche
