Throne Lyrics
Remember the moment you left me alone andBroke every promise you ever made




I was an ocean, lost in the openNothin' could take the pain away




So you can throw me to the wolvesTomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack




Beat me black and blueEvery wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne




The sticks and the stones that you used to throw haveBuilt me an empire, so don't even try




To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you




You are the reason I still fight




So you can throw me to the wolvesTomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack




Beat me black and blueEvery wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne




So you can throw me to the wolvesTomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack




Beat me black and blueEvery wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne




I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken




Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know (Know)




I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken




Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know




Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne




So you can throw me to the wolvesTomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack




Beat me black and blueEvery wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
