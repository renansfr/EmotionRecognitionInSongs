Happy Song Lyrics
S-P-I-R-I-T, spiritLet's hear itS-P-I-R-I-T, spiritLet's hear it, let's go!




I've had enoughThere's a voice in my head, says I'm better off dead




But if I sing along a little fucking louderTo a happy song, I'll be alright




You want to give upGave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut




But if you sing along a little fucking louderTo a happy song, you'll be just fine, 'cause…




Every now and again we get that feelingAnd the great big void inside us opens up




And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carouselAnd I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles




S-P-I-R-I-T, spiritLet's hear itS-P-I-R-I-T, spiritLet's hear it




We are possessedWe're all fucked in the head, alone and depressed




But if we sing along a little fucking louderTo a happy song, maybe we'll forget, 'cause…




Every now and again we get that feelingAnd the great big void inside us opens up




And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carouselAnd I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles




Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough




And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carouselAnd I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles




The world has coalescedInto one giant mess of hate and unrest




So let's all sing along a little goddamn louderTo a happy song and pretend it's all okay (Let's go)




So let's sing alongLet's sing alongA little fucking louderA little fucking louderWell, don't you feel so much better?




S-P-I-R-I-T, spiritLet's hear it (Well, that's the spirit)S-P-I-R-I-T, spiritLet's hear it (Yeah, that's the spirit)
