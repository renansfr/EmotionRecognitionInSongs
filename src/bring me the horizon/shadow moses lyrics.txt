Shadow Moses Lyrics
Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)




I thought I'd buried you and covered the tracksYou'll have to take this with your cold dead handsI thought I'd buried you, what's dead can never die




I thought I'd cut you loose, severed the feelingI slipped through the cracks and you caved in my ceilingI thought I'd buried you, what's dead can never die, fuck




Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)You can run, but you'll never escape (Over and over again)Will we ever see the end? (We're going nowhere)




This is sempiternalWill we ever see the end?This is sempiternalOver and over, again and again




Rise from the dead, you saySecrets don't sleep till they're took to the graveSignal the sirens rally the troopsLadies and gentlemen, it's the moment of truth




Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)You can run, but you'll never escape (Over and over again)Will we ever see the end? (We're going nowhere)Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)You can run, but you'll never escape (Over and over again)Will we ever see the end? (We're going nowhere)




This is sempiternalWill we ever see the end?This is sempiternalOver and over, again and again
