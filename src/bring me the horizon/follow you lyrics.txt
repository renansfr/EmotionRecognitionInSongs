Follow You Lyrics
My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghostI need to feel something, 'cause I'm still so far from homeCross your heart and hope to diePromise me you'll never leave my side




Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is goneYou got me on my knees, I'm your one-man cultCross my heart and hope to diePromise you I'll never leave your side




'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I needI promise you, you're all I see'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I needI'll never leave




So, you can drag me through hellIf it meant I could hold your handI will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spellAnd you can throw me to the flamesI will follow you, I will follow you




Come sink into me and let me breathe you inI'll be your gravity, you be my oxygenSo dig two graves, 'cause when you dieI swear I'll be leaving by your side




So you can drag me through hellIf it meant I could hold your handI will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spellAnd you can throw me to the flamesI will follow you so you can drag me through hellIf it meant I could hold your handI will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spellAnd you can throw me to the flamesI will follow you, I will follow youI will follow you, I will follow you




So you can drag me through hellIf it meant I could hold your handI will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spellAnd you can throw me to the flamesI will follow you, I will follow you
