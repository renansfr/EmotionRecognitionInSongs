Teardrops Lyrics
Teardrops




We hurt ourselves for funForce-feed our fear until our hearts go numbAddicted to a lonely kind of loveWhat I wanna know




Is how we got this stressed out, paranoid?Everything is going darkNothing makes me sadder than my head




I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stopsI can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from meOh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thingThe emptiness is heavier than you think




I'm tripping on the edgeHigh as a kite, I'm never coming down




And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels




So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid?Everything is going darkNothing makes me sadder than my head




I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stopsI can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from meOh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thingThe emptiness is heavier than you think




Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mindLost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christSuicidal, violent, tragic state of mindLost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ




I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stopsI can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from meOh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thingThe emptiness is heavier than you thinkI'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stopsI can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from meOh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thingThe emptiness is heavier than you think




TeardropsTeardropsI'm running outta teardropsThe emptiness is heavier than you think
