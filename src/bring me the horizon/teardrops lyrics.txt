TeardropsWe hurt ourselves for fun
Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb
Addicted to a lonely kind of love
What I wanna knowIs how we got this stressed out, paranoid?
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my headI'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you thinkI'm tripping on the edge
High as a kite, I'm never coming downAnd if you hear me, guess you know how it feelsSo how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid?
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my headI'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you thinkSuicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ
Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christI'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops

Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
