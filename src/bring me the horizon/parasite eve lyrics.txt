Parasite Eve Lyrics
Накривил е калпачето ей така, па такаНанагоре-нанадоле, ей така, па такаНакривил е калпачето ей така, па такаНанагоре-нанадоле, ей така, па така




I've got a fever, don't breathe on me




I'm a believer in nobody




Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen somethingHope I don't sneeze, I don't *sneeze*




Really we just need to fear somethingOnly pretending to feel somethingI know you're dying to runI wanna turn you around




Please remain calmThe end has arrivedWe cannot save youEnjoy the rideThis is the momentYou've been waiting forDon't call it a warningThis is a war




It's the Parasite EveGot a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for yaLeave your flowers and grieveDon't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayyWhen we forget the infectionWill we remember the lesson?If the suspense doesn't kill youSomething else will, ayy, ayyMove




I heard they need better signalPut chip and pins in the needlesQuarantine all of those secretsIn that black hole you call a brain before it's too late




Really we just wanna scream somethingOnly pretend to believe somethingI know you're baying for bloodI wanna turn you around (Hey)




Please remain calm (Hey)The end has arrived (Hey)We cannot save you (Hey)Enjoy the ride (Hey)This is the moment (Hey)You've been waiting for (Hey)Don't call it a warningThis is a war




It's the Parasite EveGot a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for yaLeave your flowers and grieveDon't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayyWhen we forget the infectionWill we remember the lesson?If the suspense doesn't kill youSomething else will, ayy, ayyIt's the Parasite Eve (It's the Parasite Eve)Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for yaLeave your flowers and grieveDon't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayyWhen we forget the infectionWill we remember the lesson?If the suspense doesn't kill youSomething else will




You can board up your windowsYou can lock up your doors, yeahBut you can't keep washing your handsOf this shit anymoreWhen all the king's sources and all the king's friendsDon't know their arses from their pathogens




When life is a prison and death is the doorThis ain't a warningThis is a war, warThis is a war, ayy, ayy, oh, oh




It's the Parasite EveGot a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for yaLeave your flowers and grieveDon't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayyWhen we forget the infectionWill we remember the lesson?If the suspense doesn't kill youSomething else will, ayy, ayy




It's the Parasite Eve (It's the Parasite Eve), ayy, ayyIt's the Parasite Eve, ayy, ayyIt's the Parasite Eve (Parasite Eve), ayy, ayyAyy, ayy, ayy, ayy




We cannot save youWe cannot save youWe cannot save youWe cannot save youWe cannot save you
