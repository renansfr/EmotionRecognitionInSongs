â€‹medicine Lyrics
Some people are a lot like clouds, you know(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)'Cause life's so much brighter when they go




You rained on my heart for far too long (Far too long)Couldn't see the thunder for the storm




Because I cut my teeth and bit my tongueTill my mouth was dripping bloodBut I never dished the dirt, just held my breathWhile you dragged me through the mud




I don't know why I tried to save you 'causeI can't save you from yourselfWhen all you give a shit about is everybody else




And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?I think it's time to stop




You need a taste of your own medicine'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowingWatch me take the wheel like you, not feel like youAct like nothing's real like youSo I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit




Some people are a lot like clouds, you know(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)'Cause life's so much brighter when they go




And I spent too long in a place I don't belongI couldn't see the thunder for the storm




But you won't admit, why don't you get a grip?'Cause you can't keep going on and on and on and on like thisAnd you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?I think it's time to stop




You need a taste of your own medicine'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowingWatch me take the wheel like you, not feel like youAct like nothing's real like youSo I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit




'Cause I cut my teeth and bit my tongueTill my mouth was dripping bloodBut I never dished the dirt, just held my breathWhile you dragged me through the mudYeah, I cut my teeth and bit my tongueTill my mouth was dripping bloodBut I never dished the dirt, just held my breathWhile you dragged me through the mud




And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?I think it's time to stop




You need a taste of your own medicine'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowingWatch me take the wheel like you, not feel like youAct like nothing's real like youSo I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bitTaste of your own medicine (Taste of your own medicine)Yeah, I'm sick to death of swallowing (Sick to death, oh)Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like youAct like nothing's real like youSo I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit




Some people are a lot like clouds, you know(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
