Put me outta my misery




Disconnected from the world againAnd no, the sun don't shine in the place I've beenSo why you keep acting like I don't exist?Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commit




Put me outta my misery, my mindFeels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyesI don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting goReliving my memories and they're killing me one by one




Me and that bitch, no, we can't be friendsAnd I don't even care, noGot me sinking to a dark place (Outta love)Evil twin under the staircase (Oh, my God)Think I'm looking at a long nightI'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone




Put me outta my misery, my mindFeels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyesI don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting goReliving my memories and they're killing me one by one




And I'm staring into the void again, no one knows what a mess I'm inThe voices in my head say I'm just being paranoidBut it's bad for my health, how much I hate myselfI suffocate, the weight, it pulls me underneath




Put me outta my misery, my mindFeels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyesI don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting goReliving my memories and they're killing me one by one




Yeah, it's killing me one by oneAnd they're killing me one by one
