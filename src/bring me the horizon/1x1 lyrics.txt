Put me outta my miseryDisconnected from the world again
And no, the sun don't shine in the place I've been
So why you keep acting like I don't exist?
Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commitPut me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by oneMe and that bitch, no, we can't be friends
And I don't even care, no
Got me sinking to a dark place (Outta love)
Evil twin under the staircase (Oh, my God)
Think I'm looking at a long night
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alonePut me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by oneAnd I'm staring into the void again, no one knows what a mess I'm in
The voices in my head say I'm just being paranoid
But it's bad for my health, how much I hate myself
I suffocate, the weight, it pulls me underneathPut me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by oneYeah, it's killing me one by one
And they're killing me one by one
