[Intro: Oli Sykes]
Put me outta my misery
[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
Disconnected from the world again
And no, the sun don't shine in the place I've been
So why you keep acting like I don't exist?
Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commit
[Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes]
So I ask myself, when will I learn?
I'd set myself on fire to feel the burn
I'm scared that I'm never gonna be repaired
[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one
[Verse 2: Amy Love]
Sabotaged myself again
Got a brain like a hurricane
Me and that bitch, no, we can't be friends
And I don't even care, no
Got me sinking to a dark place (Outta love)
Evil twin under the staircase (Oh, my God)
Think I'm looking at a long night
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
[Pre-Chorus: Amy Love, 
Oli Sykes
 & 
Both
]
Terrified 
(Terrified)
, I'm numb 
(But I'm numb)
Annihilation never looked so good, shut up
Hush your mouth
, you talk too much
[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one
[Bridge: Oli Sykes]
And I'm staring into the void again, no one knows what a mess I'm in
The voices in my head say I'm just being paranoid
But it's bad for my health, how much I hate myself
I suffocate, the weight, it pulls me underneath
[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one
[Outro: Oli Sykes]
Yeah, it's killing me one by one
And they're killing me one by one
