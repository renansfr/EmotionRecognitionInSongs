I didn't see it coming (Coming)
But I never really had much faith
In the universe's magic (Magic), oh, no
Till it pulled us to that time and placeAnd I'll never forget
When the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
It still has me choking; it's hard to explainI know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explainSo don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll knowNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongueSo don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll knowNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongueAnd yeah, I could be punching
But I always tend to fluctuate
And I feel sick that I'm buzzing, oh, love, I'm in troubleI'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place
I never wanna get wetBut I think we're chosen like our fates were wovenAnd all of those bad choices were left turns on the waySo don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll knowNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongueSo don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll knowNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongueI think best way to explain, it's like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, kinda like that, but a little more (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, all makes sense, right? Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll knowNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongueSo don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll knowNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongueSo don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll knowNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
