â€‹mother tongue Lyrics
I didn't see it coming (Coming)But I never really had much faithIn the universe's magic (Magic), oh, noTill it pulled us to that time and place




And I'll never forgetWhen the floodgates opened, we, we cried an oceanIt still has me choking; it's hard to explain




I know you know me, you don't have to show meI, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain




So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know




No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of thisSo I wanna hear your mother tongue




So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know




No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of thisSo I wanna hear your mother tongue




And yeah, I could be punchingBut I always tend to fluctuateAnd I feel sick that I'm buzzing, oh, love, I'm in trouble




I'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the placeI never wanna get wet




But I think we're chosen like our fates were woven




And all of those bad choices were left turns on the way




So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know




No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of thisSo I wanna hear your mother tongue




So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know




No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of thisSo I wanna hear your mother tongue




I think best way to explain, it's like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)Yeah, kinda like that, but a little more (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)Yeah, all makes sense, right? Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)




So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know




No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of thisSo I wanna hear your mother tongue




So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know




No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of thisSo I wanna hear your mother tongue




So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know




No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of thisSo I wanna hear your mother tongue
