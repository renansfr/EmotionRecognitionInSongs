MANTRA Lyrics
Do you wanna start a cult with me?




I'm not vibrating like I oughta beI need a purpose, I can't keep surfingThrough this existential misery




Now, we're gonna need some real estateBut if I choose my words carefullyThink I could fool you that I'm the guru




Wait, how do you spell "epiphany"?




Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you offBefore you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plotToo late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantraYeah!




Could I have your attention, please?It's time to tap into your tragedyThink you could use a new abuserClose your eyes and listen carefullyImagine you're stood on a beachWater gently lapping at your feetBut now you're sinking, what were you thinking?That's all the time we have this week




Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you offBefore you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plotToo late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra




And I know this doesn't make a lot of senseBut do you really wanna think all by yourself now?All I'm asking for's a little bit of faithYou know it's easy to believeAnd I know this doesn't make a lot of senseYou know you gotta work the corners of your mind nowAll I'm asking for's a little bit of faithYou know it's easy to, so easy to believe




Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you offBefore you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plotBefore the truth will set you free, it'll piss you offBefore you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plotToo late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantraOh!
