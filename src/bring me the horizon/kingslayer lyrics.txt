Kingslayer Lyrics
I need to know where your loyalties lieTell me, are you gonna bark or bite?




Do you really wanna twist a knife in the bellyOf the monster?




Get the fuck up, wake the fuck upWipe the system and back the fuck upYou're a puppet, when they cut your strings offDon't comе crawling back




暗い、この見えない世界まだ消えない未来ただ手に入れたい another world




Get the fuck up, wake the fuck upWipe the system and back the fuck upYou're a puppet, when they cut your strings offDon't come crawling back, you're on your own




さあ時の扉を開けて行こうよ




Kingslayer, destroying castles in the skyKingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye




We're going down the rabbit holeAre you ready?I can't feel youOh, yeah




Is this what you want?This is what you'll fucking getYou motherfucking shit
