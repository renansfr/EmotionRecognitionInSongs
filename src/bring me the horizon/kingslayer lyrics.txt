Kingslayer Lyrics
[Intro: Oli Sykes]
Blegh
[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
Hi, are you looking for the other side?
Feel like nothing ever seems quite right?
Are you circling the drainpipe, getting off on pain like
You're corrupted?
I need to know where your loyalties lie
Tell me, are you gonna bark or bite?
Do you really wanna twist a knife in the belly
Of the monster?
[Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes]
Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system and back the fuck up
You're a puppet, when they cut your strings off
Don't comе crawling back
[Chorus: Su-Metal]
Kingslayer, destroying castles in thе sky
Kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye
I'd sacrifice my life to find you, angel of the blade
Kingslayer, come and collect us from the night
[Verse 2: Su-Metal, 
Oli Sykes

暗い、この見えない世界
まだ消えない未来
ただ手に入れたい another world
System failure
Life is encrypted, you are modified
Like a virus in a lullaby
Artificial 'til the day you die, silly programme
You're corrupted
[Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes, 
Su-Metal
]
Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system and back the fuck up
You're a puppet, when they cut your strings off
Don't come crawling back, you're on your own
さあ時の扉を開けて行こうよ
[Chorus: Su-Metal, 
Su-Metal & Oli Sykes
]
Kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky
Kingslayer, I'll fight for you until I die
Kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky
Kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye
I'd sacrifice it all to guide you, never have to battle alone
Kingslayer, come and collect us from the night
[Breakdown: Oli Sykes, 
Su-Metal
]
This is your wake up call
We're going down the rabbit hole
Are you ready?
I can't feel you
Oh, yeah
[Outro: Oli Sykes]
Is this what you want?
This is what you'll fucking get
You motherfucking shit
