I need to know where your loyalties lie
Tell me, are you gonna bark or bite?Do you really wanna twist a knife in the belly
Of the monster?Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system and back the fuck up
You're a puppet, when they cut your strings off
Don't comе crawling back暗い、この見えない世界
まだ消えない未来
ただ手に入れたい another worldGet the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system and back the fuck up
You're a puppet, when they cut your strings off
Don't come crawling back, you're on your own
Kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky
Kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eyeWe're going down the rabbit hole
Are you ready?
I can't feel you

Is this what you want?
This is what you'll fucking get
You motherfucking shit
