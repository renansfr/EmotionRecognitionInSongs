Obey Lyrics
Another day, another post-traumatic orderBrainwashed and feeling fineI bit off more than I could chew when I looked closerSo I stabbed a fork in my eye




Think I'm losing my fucking mindDon't know where to turn, now I'm blindDestroy yourself, it feels so good to fade awayWhy do you wanna hurt yourself?Die for something else?Don't let your conscience get in the way




Obey, we hope you have a lovely dayObey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, nowThere's nothing to see here, it's under controlWe're only gambling with your soulObey, whatever you doJust don't wake up and smell the corruption




Another day, another systematic nightmare




Commemorate a wonderful life




Think I'm out my fucking mindBrainwashed and I'm feeling fineDestroy yourself, it feels too good to fade awayWhy do I wanna hurt myself?Should I die for something else?I let my conscience get in the way




Obey, we hope you have a lovely dayObey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, nowThere's nothing to see here, it's under controlWe're only gambling with your soulObey, whatever you doJust don't wake up and smell the corruption




Obey, we're gonna show you how to behaveObey, it's nicer when you can't see the chains




Obey, we hope you have a lovely dayObey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, nowThere's nothing to see here, it's under control (It's under control)We're only gambling with your soul (With your soul)Obey, whatever you doJust don't wake up and smell the corruption




Smell the corruptionSmell the corruption
