Another day, another post-traumatic order
Brainwashed and feeling fine
I bit off more than I could chew when I looked closer
So I stabbed a fork in my eyeThink I'm losing my fucking mind
Don't know where to turn, now I'm blind
Destroy yourself, it feels so good to fade away
Why do you wanna hurt yourself?
Die for something else?
Don't let your conscience get in the wayObey, we hope you have a lovely day
Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey, whatever you do
Just don't wake up and smell the corruptionAnother day, another systematic nightmareCommemorate a wonderful lifeThink I'm out my fucking mind
Brainwashed and I'm feeling fine
Destroy yourself, it feels too good to fade away
Why do I wanna hurt myself?
Should I die for something else?
I let my conscience get in the wayObey, we hope you have a lovely day
Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey, whatever you do
Just don't wake up and smell the corruptionObey, 

Obey, 
Obey, we hope you have a lovely day
Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control (It's under control)
We're only gambling with your soul (With your soul)
Obey, whatever you do
Just don't wake up and smell the corruptionSmell the corruption
