Doomed Lyrics
[That's The Spirit Tour Extended Intro]Sometimes I wonder why are we all hereCall me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclearTo why I bother, why I tryDeath is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna dieI lost my wife this year, we've lost our friendAlways fighting battles, but it never seem to endAre we just ladders in the world of snakes?'Cause if life's one big fuckin' game, well, I don't wanna playSo come and sing me, sing me to sleepI dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now I'm in too deepCut off my wings, my flowers bloomedYou want salvation? Well, I'm sorry, we're all doomed




[Intro]




Cut off my wings and come lock me upJust pull the plug, yeah, I've had enoughTear me to pieces, sell me for partsYou're all vampires, so here




You can have my heart (My heart, heart)You can have my heart (My heart, heart)You can have my heart (My heart, heart)You can have my heart (My heart, heart)You can have my




The world's a funeral, a room of ghostsNo hint of movement, no sign of pulseOnly an echo, just skin and bone




They kicked the chair, but weWe helped tie the rope




You can have my heart (My heart, heart)You can have my heart (My heart, heart)You can have my heart (My heart, heart)You can have my




So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel itCome shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdriveI'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth savingSo come rain on my parade




I think we're doomedI think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back




You must've made some kind of mistakeI asked for death, but instead, I'm awakeThe Devil told me, "No room for cheats"I thought I'd sold my soul, but he kept the receipt




So leave a light on, I'm coming homeIt's getting darker, but I'll carry onThe sun don't shine but it never didAnd when it rains, it fuckin' pours, but I think I like itAnd you know that I'm in love with the mess, I think I like it




So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel itCome shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdriveI'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth savingSo come rain on my parade




I think we're doomedI think we're doomed, and now, there's no way backI think we're doomedI think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back




So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel itCome shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdriveI'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth savingSo come rain on my parade




I think we're doomedI think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back




[Outro]
