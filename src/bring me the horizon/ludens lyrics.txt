Ludens Lyrics
Some resist the future, some refuse the pastEither way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the factThat a world covered in cables was never wired to lastSo don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash




(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?You're like a phantom greeting meWe plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallowsStuck in a loop for eternity




Do you know why the flowers never bloom?Will you retry or let the pain resume?I need a new leader, we need a new Luden(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)So come outside, it's time to see the tideIt's out of sight, but never out of mindI need a new leader, we need a new Luden




Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass




But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand




And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followedAnd the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show




(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?You're like a phantom greeting meWe plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallowsStuck in a loop for eternity




Do you know why the flowers never bloom?Will you retry or let the pain resume?I need a new leader, we need a new Luden(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)So come outside, it's time to see the tideIt's out of sight, but never out of mindI need a new leader, we need a new LudenA new Luden, new Luden, yeahA new Luden, new Luden, yeahA new Luden, new Luden, yeahA new Luden, new Luden, yeahYeah




Alright, you call this a connection?You call this a connection?You call this a connection? OkayYou call this a connection?Oh, give me a breakOh, give me a breakOh, give me a break (Okay)Ugh, ooh




Do you know why the flowers never bloom?Will you retry or let the pain resume?I need a new leader, we need a new Luden(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)So come outside, it's time to see the tideIt's out of sight, but never out of mindI need a new leader, we need a new LudenA new Luden, new Luden, yeahA new Luden, new Luden, yeahA new Luden, new Luden, yeahA new Luden, new Luden, yeah




Do you know why the flowers never bloom?Will you retry or let the pain resume?I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
