Can You Feel My Heart Lyrics
Can you hear the silence?Can you see the dark?Can you fix the broken?Can you feel, can you feel my heart?(Can you feel my heart?)




Can you help the hopeless? Well, I'm begging on my kneesCan you save my bastard soul, will you wait for me?I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, loverForgive me, father, I love you, mother




Can you hear the silence? Can you see the dark?Can you fix the broken? Can you feel my heart?Can you feel my heart?(Can you feel my heart?)(Can you feel my heart?)




I'm scared to get close and I hate being aloneI long for that feeling to not feel at allThe higher I get, the lower I'll sinkI can't drown my demons, they know how to swimI'm scared to get close and I hate being aloneI long for that feeling to not feel at allThe higher I get, the lower I'll sinkI can't drown my demons, they know how to swimI'm scared to get close and I hate being aloneI long for that feeling to not feel at allThe higher I get, the lower I'll sinkI can't drown my demons, they know how to swim




(Can you feel my heart?)Can you hear the silence?Can you see the dark?Can you fix the broken?Can you feel, can you feel my heart?
