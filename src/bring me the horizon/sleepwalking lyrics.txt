Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to singMy skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breatheTime stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalkingI'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here, do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim or simply disappear?Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to singMy skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe, sing itTime stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalkingWake up
Take my hand and give me a reason to start again
Wake up
Pull me out and give me a reason to start againTime stands still (Time stands still)
Time stands still (Time stands still)Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to singMy skin is smothering meHelp me find a way to breatheTime stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking (It's like I'm sleepwalking)(It's like I'm sleepwalking, it's like I'm sleepwalking)
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
