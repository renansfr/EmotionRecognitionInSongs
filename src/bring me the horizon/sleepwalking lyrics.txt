Sleepwalking Lyrics
Your eyes are swallowing meMirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing




My skin's smothering meHelp me find a way to breathe




Time stood still the way it did beforeIt's like I'm sleepwalkingFell into another hole againIt's like I'm sleepwalking




I'm at the edge of the worldWhere do I go from here, do I disappear?Edge of the worldShould I sink or swim or simply disappear?




Your eyes are swallowing meMirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing




My skin's smothering meHelp me find a way to breathe, sing it




Time stood still the way it did beforeIt's like I'm sleepwalkingFell into another hole againIt's like I'm sleepwalking




Wake upTake my hand and give me a reason to start againWake upPull me out and give me a reason to start again




Time stands still (Time stands still)Time stands still (Time stands still)




Your eyes are swallowing meMirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing




My skin is smothering me




Help me find a way to breathe




Time stood still the way it did beforeIt's like I'm sleepwalkingFell into another hole againIt's like I'm sleepwalking (It's like I'm sleepwalking)




(It's like I'm sleepwalking, it's like I'm sleepwalking)Time stood still the way it did beforeIt's like I'm sleepwalking
